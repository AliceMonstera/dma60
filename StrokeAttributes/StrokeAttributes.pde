/*
The placement of shapes like rect() and ellipse() is controlled with the rectMode() and ellipseMode() functions. Check the reference

(Help‚ûùReference) to see examples of how to place rectangles from their center (rather than their upper-left corner), or to draw ellipses from their

upper-left corner like rectangles.

When any of these attributes are set, all shapes drawn afterward are affected. For instance, in Example 3-12, notice how the second and third

circles both have the same stroke weight, even though the weight is set only once before both are drawn.
